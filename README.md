# vishivishvish.github.io

This repository hosts my personal website, built and deployed using GitHub Pages.

The site serves as a living portfolio of:
- ideas
- projects
- experiments
- notes
- long-form thinking

It is intentionally minimal, transparent, and version-controlled.

---

## Purpose

This website is not just a showcase — it is an evolving system.

The goals are to:
- document professional and personal work in a durable, inspectable way
- practice disciplined use of Git, GitHub, and pull-request–based workflows
- treat writing, research, and engineering artifacts as first-class code
- provide a stable public surface for long-term projects

Over time, this site will grow alongside my skills and interests.

## Philosophy

A few guiding principles:

- **Clarity over polish**  
  Simple HTML, CSS, and content-first design.

- **Versioned thinking**  
  Ideas evolve; Git history captures that evolution.

- **Minimal abstraction**  
  No frameworks initially — fundamentals first.

- **Future-compatible**  
  Designed to integrate with automation, tooling, and agentic workflows later.

---

## Structure (initial)

/
├── index.html # Main landing page
├── style.css # Global styles
├── README.md # This document


Additional sections (e.g. ideas, projects, research, agents) will be added incrementally.

---

## Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.

- Source: `main` branch
- Folder: `/ (root)`
- URL: https://vishivishvish.github.io

Any commit to `main` updates the live site.

---

## Notes on evolution

This repository may later be used as:
- a testbed for automation
- a target for CLI tooling
- an interface for agent-driven pull requests

Changes will be deliberate and reviewable.
