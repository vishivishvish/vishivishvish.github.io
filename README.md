## Introduction & Purpose

This repository hosts my personal website, built and deployed using GitHub Pages and Agentic AI.

This site will serve as a living portfolio of:
- ideas
- projects
- experiments
- notes
- long-form thinking

The goals are to:
- document professional and personal work in a durable, inspectable way
- practice disciplined use of Git, GitHub, and pull-request–based workflows
- treat writing, research, and engineering artifacts as first-class code
- provide a stable public surface for long-term projects

The site is currently & intentionally minimal, transparent, and version-controlled.

Over time, this site will grow alongside my skills and interests.

## Philosophy

A few guiding principles:

- **Clarity over polish**  
  Simple HTML, CSS, and content-first design.

- **Versioned thinking**  
  Ideas evolve; Git history captures that evolution.

- **Minimal abstraction**  
  No frameworks initially — fundamentals first.

- **Future-compatible**  
  Designed to integrate with automation, tooling, and agentic workflows later.

## Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.

- Source: `main` branch
- Folder: `/ (root)`
- URL: https://vishivishvish.github.io

Any commit to `main` updates the live site.

## Notes on Evolution

This site is part of a much larger experiment.

I am a 100% **RSI-pilled (Recursive Self-Improvement)** AI Engineer, so this repository is designed to eventually move beyond static authorship. Over time, it is intended to reach the **OpenClaw stage**: autonomous agents will propose changes to the codebase, submit pull requests, and improve the site incrementally — with my human review and approval acting as the safety and alignment layer.

In other words, this website is meant to **update itself**.

But, and here's the kickass part where it gets **meta**, the agents driving these updates are not operating in isolation. Their learning process is tightly coupled to my own exploratory research across a wide and evolving set of scientific, engineering, and mathematical disciplines — areas that reflect both long-term professional goals and genuine intellectual curiosity.

Some initial domains include:

- 🧠 **Software Engineering & System Design**
- 🖥️ **IT & Hardware Engineering**
- 🔐 **Network Engineering & Cybersecurity**
- 📊 **Statistical Data Analysis, Data Visualization & Database Management**
- 🏗️ **Data Engineering & Big Data Technology**
- 🤖 **Data Science, Machine Learning Mathematics & Research**
- ☁️ **ML Engineering, Cloud Deployment & Productionization**
- 🧩 **LLM, Generative AI & Agentic AI Technology**
- ⚡ **GPU Programming**
- 📐 **Mathematical Science & Engineering**
- 🧮 **Abacus Mathematics**
- 📜 **Vedic Mathematics**
- 💹 **Quantitative Trading & Finance**
- 📈 **Financial Analysis & Econometrics**
- 🧬 **Biological Science & Engineering**
- 🧠 **Neuroscience & Neuropsychology**
- 🧠🤖 **Neuro-engineering & Brain-Machine Interfaces**
- 🦾 **Robotics & Ground-based Autonomous Systems Engineering**
- 🚁 **Drones & Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Design**
- 🔌 **Electronics & Electrical Engineering**
- 🧱 **Materials Science & Engineering**
- ⚗️ **Chemistry & Chemical Engineering**
- 🧪 **Nanotechnology & Nanomaterials Engineering**
- 🚀 **Rocket Engineering**
- 🛰️ **Satellite & Space Systems Engineering**
- 🌌 **Engineering Physics & Astronomy**
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing**

This list is not fixed — it is expected to evolve.

What this crucially boils down to is - the **agentic learning process itself** is also undergoing recursive self-improvement. While agents improve the codebase, they also utilize an ever-growing compendium of ideas from the above fields to refine how learning artifacts, research notes, and conceptual frameworks are generated, evaluated, and integrated. In effect, this will create a feedback loop where **the first derivative of learning quality itself improves over time**.

This repository is therefore not just a website.

It is a substrate for:
- versioned thinking
- agent-assisted creation
- and long-horizon intellectual compounding

You are seeing it early.
