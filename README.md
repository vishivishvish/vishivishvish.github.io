# AI/ML Computational Science Engineer @ Accenture

## Introduction & Purpose

This repository hosts my personal website, built and deployed using GitHub Pages and Agentic AI.

This site will serve as a living portfolio of:
- 💡 ideas
- 🛠️ projects
- 🧪 experiments
- 📝 notes
- 📚 long-form thinking

The goals are to:
- 🧱 document professional and personal work in a durable, inspectable way
- 🌱 practice disciplined use of Git, GitHub, and pull-request–based workflows
- 🧬 treat writing, research, and engineering artifacts as first-class code
- 🧭 provide a stable public surface for long-term projects

The site is currently & intentionally minimal, transparent, and version-controlled.

Over time, this site will grow alongside my skills and interests.

## Philosophy

A few guiding principles:

- ✨ **Clarity over polish**  
  Simple HTML, CSS, and content-first design.

- 🧠 **Versioned thinking**  
  Ideas evolve; Git history captures that evolution.

- 🪶 **Minimal abstraction**  
  No frameworks initially — fundamentals first.

- 🚀 **Future-compatible**  
  Designed to integrate with automation, tooling, and agentic workflows later.

## Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.

- 🌿 Source: `main` branch
- 📂 Folder: `/ (root)`
- 🌐 URL: https://vishivishvish.github.io 

Any commit to `main` updates the live site.

## Notes on Evolution

This site is part of a much larger experiment.

Since I was a kid, I’ve wanted to pursue the path of a true polymath: conducting exploratory research (and eventually development) across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. Some of the domains currently driving that curiosity include:

- 🧠 **Software Engineering & System Design**
- 🖥️ **IT & Hardware Engineering**
- 🔐 **Network Engineering & Cybersecurity**
- 📊 **Statistical Data Analysis, Data Visualization & Database Management**
- 🏗️ **Data Engineering & Big Data Technology**
- 🤖 **Data Science, Machine Learning Mathematics & Research**
- ☁️ **ML Engineering, Cloud Deployment & Productionization**
- 🧩 **LLM, Generative AI & Agentic AI Technology**
- ⚡ **GPU Programming**
- 📐 **Mathematical Science & Engineering**
- 🧮 **Abacus Mathematics**
- 📜 **Vedic Mathematics**
- 💹 **Quantitative Trading & Finance**
- 📈 **Financial Analysis & Econometrics**
- 🧬 **Biological Science & Engineering**
- 🧠 **Neuroscience & Neuropsychology**
- 🧠🤖 **Neuro-engineering & Brain-Machine Interfaces**
- 🦾 **Robotics & Ground-based Autonomous Systems Engineering**
- 🚁 **Drones & Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Design**
- 🔌 **Electronics & Electrical Engineering**
- 🧱 **Materials Science & Engineering**
- ⚗️ **Chemistry & Chemical Engineering**
- 🧪 **Nanotechnology & Nanomaterials Engineering**
- 🚀 **Rocket Engineering**
- 🛰️ **Satellite & Space Systems Engineering**
- 🌌 **Engineering Physics & Astronomy**
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing**

This list is not fixed. It is expected to evolve as interests deepen, intersect, and compound.

But the ambition goes one layer deeper.

The knowledge gathered across these fields is not only for formal learning or note-taking (valuable as that already is). It is also being used to explore a meta-question:

**How does learning itself improve?**

In parallel, I am attempting three interconnected tracks:

1. **Conceptual track**  
   Distill first principles about learning across disciplines, and extract patterns about abstraction, generalization, compression, and iteration. These become research artifacts in their own right.

2. **Practical track**  
   Build and experiment with a “learning baby_agent” — a codebase that ingests inputs, runs experiments, evolves behaviors, and generates research outputs. The code and resulting papers form a second layer of artifacts.

3. **Recursive track**  
   Use all accumulated artifacts: learning notes, conceptual frameworks, evolving agent code, and research papers, to inform another agent that suggests improvements to the learning paradigm itself.

This is the attempt to **close the loop**.

In other words: a grounded exploration of **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**, not as fantasy, but as an engineering discipline.

Over time, this repository is intended to move beyond static authorship. Autonomous agents will propose code changes, submit pull requests, and incrementally improve both the website and the learning systems behind it, with human review acting as the alignment and safety layer.

The key is that the agents are not isolated optimizers.  
Their learning is tightly coupled to my own exploratory research across these evolving disciplines.

As the knowledge base grows, the agents gain access to a richer conceptual substrate.  
As the agents improve, they help refine how that knowledge is structured, tested, and integrated.

The feedback loop strengthens.

If this works, the system approaches a state where **the rate of learning itself improves over time** — constrained primarily by context limits, compute, and disciplined execution.

This repository, then, is not merely a portfolio site.

It is an evolving substrate for:
- long-horizon intellectual compounding
- agent-assisted research
- and an engineering-first exploration of RSI

Where this ultimately leads is impossible to predict.

What is already in motion, however, is a growing stack of notes, repositories, experiments, and research artifacts, all feeding back into how these agents learn and improve.

The entire system is being built on locally hosted, open-source LLMs and consumer hardware - no recurring platform rent, no hidden black boxes.

Five years ago, this would have been dismissed as fantasy. That speaks volumes of how the AI Industry has been moving ahead at warp speed these last few years.

True RSI or not, this is easily the most ambitious, and most fun, system I’ve ever tried to build.

Let’s see how far it goes.
