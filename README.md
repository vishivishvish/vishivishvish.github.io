## Introduction & Purpose

This repository hosts my personal website, built and deployed using GitHub Pages and Agentic AI.

This site will serve as a living portfolio of:
- 💡 ideas
- 🛠️ projects
- 🧪 experiments
- 📝 notes
- 📚 long-form thinking

The goals are to:
- 🧱 document professional and personal work in a durable, inspectable way
- 🌱 practice disciplined use of Git, GitHub, and pull-request–based workflows
- 🧬 treat writing, research, and engineering artifacts as first-class code
- 🧭 provide a stable public surface for long-term projects

The site is currently & intentionally minimal, transparent, and version-controlled.

Over time, this site will grow alongside my skills and interests.

## Philosophy

A few guiding principles:

- ✨ **Clarity over polish**  
  Simple HTML, CSS, and content-first design.

- 🧠 **Versioned thinking**  
  Ideas evolve; Git history captures that evolution.

- 🪶 **Minimal abstraction**  
  No frameworks initially — fundamentals first.

- 🚀 **Future-compatible**  
  Designed to integrate with automation, tooling, and agentic workflows later.

## Deployment

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.

- 🌿 Source: `main` branch
- 📂 Folder: `/ (root)`
- 🌐 URL: https://vishivishvish.github.io


Any commit to `main` updates the live site.

## Notes on Evolution

This site is part of a much larger experiment.

I am a **100% RSI-pilled (Recursive Self-Improvement)** 🤯 AI Engineer, so this repository is designed to eventually move beyond static authorship. Over time, it is intended to reach the stage where **autonomous agents will propose changes to the codebase, submit pull requests, and improve the site incrementally** — with my human review and approval acting as the safety and alignment layer.

In other words, this website is meant to **update itself**.

But, and here's the kickass part where it gets **meta**, the agents driving these updates are not operating in isolation. Their learning process is tightly coupled to my own exploratory research across a wide and evolving set of scientific, engineering, and mathematical disciplines — areas that reflect both long-term professional goals and genuine intellectual curiosity.

Some initial domains include:

- 🧠 **Software Engineering & System Design**
- 🖥️ **IT & Hardware Engineering**
- 🔐 **Network Engineering & Cybersecurity**
- 📊 **Statistical Data Analysis, Data Visualization & Database Management**
- 🏗️ **Data Engineering & Big Data Technology**
- 🤖 **Data Science, Machine Learning Mathematics & Research**
- ☁️ **ML Engineering, Cloud Deployment & Productionization**
- 🧩 **LLM, Generative AI & Agentic AI Technology**
- ⚡ **GPU Programming**
- 📐 **Mathematical Science & Engineering**
- 🧮 **Abacus Mathematics**
- 📜 **Vedic Mathematics**
- 💹 **Quantitative Trading & Finance**
- 📈 **Financial Analysis & Econometrics**
- 🧬 **Biological Science & Engineering**
- 🧠 **Neuroscience & Neuropsychology**
- 🧠🤖 **Neuro-engineering & Brain-Machine Interfaces**
- 🦾 **Robotics & Ground-based Autonomous Systems Engineering**
- 🚁 **Drones & Autonomous Aerial Vehicle Design**
- 🔌 **Electronics & Electrical Engineering**
- 🧱 **Materials Science & Engineering**
- ⚗️ **Chemistry & Chemical Engineering**
- 🧪 **Nanotechnology & Nanomaterials Engineering**
- 🚀 **Rocket Engineering**
- 🛰️ **Satellite & Space Systems Engineering**
- 🌌 **Engineering Physics & Astronomy**
- ⚛️ **Quantum Computing**

This list is not fixed — it is expected to evolve.

What this crucially boils down to is - the **agentic learning process itself** is also undergoing a form of recursive self-improvement. While agents improve the codebase, they also utilize an ever-growing compendium of ideas from the above fields to refine how learning artifacts, research notes, and conceptual frameworks are generated, evaluated, and integrated into their self-improvement philosophy. In effect, this will create a feedback loop where **the first derivative of learning quality itself improves over time**.

This repository is therefore not just a website.

It is a substrate for:
- versioned thinking
- agent-assisted creation
- and long-horizon intellectual compounding

Where this ultimately leads is anyone’s guess.

What’s already in motion, though, is a growing stack of learning notes, GitHub repositories, experiments, and research artifacts — all feeding back into how my agents learn and improve. The whole thing is being built on locally hosted, open-source LLMs and consumer hardware, with no recurring platform rent and no magic black boxes.

True RSI or not, this is easily the most ambitious (and frankly, the most fun) system I’ve ever tried to build.

You are seeing it early.
